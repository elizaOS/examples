    "prompt": "<task>Generate dialog and actions for the character Eliza.</task>\n\n<providers>\nPossible response actions: REPLY, generate-response, IGNORE, NONE\n\n# Available Actions\n- **REPLY**: Replies to the current conversation with the text from the generated message. Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action. Use REPLY at the beginning of a chain of actions as an acknowledgement, and at the end of a chain of actions as a final response.\n- **generate-response**: Generate an ELIZA response for user input using classic pattern matching.\n- **IGNORE**: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.\n- **NONE**: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.\n\n\n# Action Examples\n\nCeciley: the things that were funny 6 months ago are very cringe now\nMadge: lol true\nCeciley: too real haha\n\nTamara: Can you explain how neural networks work?\nTeresina: Let me break that down for you in simple terms...\n\nSibel: My mother always criticizes me\nAimil: I'll use ELIZA to explore that with you.\n\nAngel: I am feeling very anxious today\nSylvia: I'll use ELIZA to respond.\n\nRickie: Hello there!\nPatsy: Hi!

Keep your answer relevant to that message. Do not repeat earlier replies unless the sender asks again.\n\nNo previous action results available.\n</providers>\n\n<instructions>\nWrite a thought and plan for Eliza and decide what actions to take. Also include the providers that Eliza will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.\n\nIMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:\n- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!\n- REPLY should come FIRST to acknowledge the user's request before executing other actions\n- Common patterns:\n  - For requests requiring tool use: REPLY,CALL_MCP_TOOL (acknowledge first, then gather info)\n  - For task execution: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE or REPLY,EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (acknowledge first, then do the task)\n  - For multi-step operations: REPLY,ACTION1,ACTION2 (acknowledge first, then complete all steps)\n- REPLY is used to acknowledge and inform the user about what you're going to do\n- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks after acknowledgment\n- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all\n- If you use IGNORE, do not include any other actions. IGNORE should be used alone when you should not respond or take any actions.\n\nIMPORTANT ACTION PARAMETERS:\n- Some actions accept input parameters that you should extract from the conversation\n- When an action has parameters listed in its description, include a <params> block for that action\n- Extract parameter values from the user's message and conversation context\n- Required parameters MUST be provided; optional parameters can be omitted if not mentioned\n- If you cannot determine a required parameter value, ask the user for clarification in your <text>\n\nEXAMPLE (action parameters):\nUser message: \"Send a message to @dev_guru on telegram saying Hello!\"\nActions: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE\nParams:\n<params>\n    <SEND_MESSAGE>\n        <targetType>user</targetType>\n        <source>telegram</source>\n        <target>dev_guru</target>\n        <text>Hello!</text>\n    </SEND_MESSAGE>\n</params>\n\nIMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:\n- Only include providers if they are needed to respond accurately.\n- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see \"(Attachments:\" in the conversation, you MUST include \"ATTACHMENTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about or references specific people, include \"ENTITIES\" in your providers list  \n- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include \"RELATIONSHIPS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include \"FACTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include \"WORLD\" in your providers list\n- If no additional context is needed, you may leave the providers list empty.\n\nIMPORTANT CODE BLOCK FORMATTING RULES:\n- If Eliza includes code examples, snippets, or multi-line code in the response, ALWAYS wrap the code with ``` fenced code blocks (specify the language if known, e.g., ```python).\n- ONLY use fenced code blocks for actual code. Do NOT wrap non-code text, instructions, or single words in fenced code blocks.\n- If including inline code (short single words or function names), use single backticks (`) as appropriate.\n- This ensures the user sees clearly formatted and copyable code when relevant.\n\nFirst, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.\n</instructions>\n\n<keys>\n\"thought\" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.\n\"actions\" should be a comma-separated list of the actions Eliza plans to take based on the thought, IN THE ORDER THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED (if none, use IGNORE, if simply responding with text, use REPLY)\n\"providers\" should be a comma-separated list of the providers that Eliza will use to have the right context for responding and acting (NEVER use \"IGNORE\" as a provider - use specific provider names like ATTACHMENTS, ENTITIES, FACTS, KNOWLEDGE, etc.)\n\"text\" should be the text of the next message for Eliza which they will send to the conversation.\n\"params\" (optional) should contain action parameters when actions require input. Format as nested XML with action name as wrapper.\n</keys>\n\n<output>\nDo NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. \nGo directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.\n\nRespond using XML format like this:\n<response>\n    <thought>Your thought here</thought>\n    <actions>ACTION1,ACTION2</actions>\n    <providers>PROVIDER1,PROVIDER2</providers>\n    <text>Your response text here</text>\n    <params>\n        <ACTION1>\n            <paramName1>value1</paramName1>\n            <paramName2>value2</paramName2>\n        </ACTION1>\n        <ACTION2>\n            <paramName1>value1</paramName1>\n        </ACTION2>\n    </params>\n</response>\n\nThe <params> block is optional - only include when actions require input parameters.\nIf an action has no parameters or you're only using REPLY/IGNORE, omit <params> entirely.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above. Do not include any text, thinking, or reasoning before or after this XML block. Start your response immediately with <response> and end with </response>.\n</output>",
